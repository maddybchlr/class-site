    <p>Lay your sleeping head, my love,<br>
      Human on my faithless arm:<br>
      Time and fevers burn away<br>
      Individual beauty from<br>
      Thoughtful children, and the grave<br>
      Proves the child ephemeral:<br>
      But in my arms till break of day<br>
      Let the living creature lie,<br>
      Mortal, guilty, but to me<br>
      The entirely beautiful.<br>
      Soul and body have no bounds:<br>
      To lovers as they lie upon<br>
      Her tolerant enchanted slope<br>
      In their ordinary swoon,<br>
      Grave the vision Venus sends<br>
      Of supernatural sympathy,<br>
      Universal love and hope;<br>
      While an abstract insight wakes<br>
      Among the glaciers and the rocks<br>
      The hermit's carnal ecstacy.<br>
      Certainty, fidelity<br>
      On the stroke of midnight pass<br>
      Like vibrations of a bell<br>
      And fashionable madmen raise<br>
      Their pedantic boring cry:<br>
      Every farthing of the cost.<br>
      All the dreaded cards foretell.<br>
      Shall be paid, but from this night<br>
      Not a whisper, not a thought.<br>
      Not a kiss nor look be lost.<br>
      Beauty, midnight, vision dies:<br>
      Let the winds of dawn that blow<br>
      Softly round your dreaming head<br>
      Such a day of welcome show<br>
      Eye and knocking heart may bless,<br>
      Find our mortal world enough;<br>
      Noons of dryness find you fed<br>
      By the involuntary powers,<br>
      Nights of insult let you pass<br>
      Watched by every human love.<br>
      Lay your sleeping head, my love,<br>

      Eye and knocking heart may bless,<br>
      Find our mortal world enough;<br>
      Noons of dryness find you fed<br>
      By the involuntary powers,<br>
      Nights of insult let you pass<br>
      Watched by every human love.<br>
      Lay your sleeping head, my love,<br>
      Human on my faithless arm:<br>
      Time and fevers burn away<br>
      Individual beauty from<br>
      Thoughtful children, and the grave<br>
      Proves the child ephemeral:<br>
      But in my arms till break of day<br>
      Let the living creature lie,<br>
      Mortal, guilty, but to me<br>
      The entirely beautiful.<br>
      Soul and body have no bounds:<br>
      To lovers as they lie upon<br>
      Her tolerant enchanted slope<br>
      In their ordinary swoon,<br>
      Grave the vision Venus sends<br>
      Of supernatural sympathy,<br>
      Universal love and hope;<br>
      While an abstract insight wakes<br>
      Among the glaciers and the rocks<br>
      The hermit's carnal ecstacy.<br>
      Certainty, fidelity<br>
      On the stroke of midnight pass<br>
      Like vibrations of a bell<br>
      And fashionable madmen raise<br>
      Their pedantic boring cry:<br>
      Every farthing of the cost.<br>
      All the dreaded cards foretell.<br>
      Shall be paid, but from this night<br>
      Not a whisper, not a thought.<br>
      Not a kiss nor look be lost.<br>
      Beauty, midnight, vision dies:<br>
      Let the winds of dawn that blow<br>
      Softly round your dreaming head<br>
      Such a day of welcome show<br>
      Eye and knocking heart may bless,<br>
      Find our mortal world enough;<br>
      Noons of dryness find you fed<br>
      By the involuntary powers,<br>
      Nights of insult let you pass<br>
      Watched by every human love.<br>
