    <ul style="font-family:overpass; font-size:10.5pt">
      <li>"everything" represented by search result from 3-year period</li><br>

      <li>"calls attention to the way one user's language was shaped by the larger system that surrounded it"</li><br>

      <li>"sometimes revealing, but mostly opaque"</li><br>

      <li>"use of such data to <u>measure and classify</u> users"</li><br>

      <li>emphasis on language over content</li><br>

      <li>the act of searching over the search terms themselves</li><br>

      <li>unique because no intervention into Google's usual function</li><br>

      <li>OuLiPo → systematic and self-restricting way of making texts, rejected the idea that the unconscious should be a primary souce for literary production</li><br>

      <li>project "leaves the reader uncertain as to whether this data set offers more than a glimpse of her interior life"</li><br>

      <li>"Syms reduces herself to her activity as an internet user"</li><br>

      <li>activity as performance → did the fact that she was keeping record change her searching habits?</li><br>

      <li>why don't searches link to the search results? → "you could see what I was interested in, but you wouldn't get to see anything more"</li><br>
