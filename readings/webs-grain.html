    <ul style="font-family:overpass; font-size:10.5pt">
      <li>“We begin in admiration and end by organizing our disappointment.”</li><br>

      <li>“I wanted to take something big and make it small again.”</li><br>

      <li>“Before I began to practice, mountains were mountains and rivers were rivers. After I began to practice, mountains were no longer mountains and rivers were no longer rivers. Now, I have practiced for some time, and mountains are again mountains, and rivers are again rivers.”</li><br>

      <li>primary visual challenge = responsive design</li><br>

      <li>“…the only choice is to recognize it as implicit to the medium, and devise strategies to manage it.”</li><br>

      <li>each step we take away from the medium’s intentions makes our creations weaker — working against the grain, swimming up stream and climbing uphill</li><br>

      <li>“It is fascinating that you can do that, but it’s really not what a website is supposed to do.”</li><br>

      <li>every material has a grain, including the web</li><br>

      <li>internet = infinitely malleable material</li><br>

      <li>“Many sites will share design solutions, because we’re using the same materials.”</li><br>

      <li>“What would happen if we stopped treating the web like a blank canvas to paint on, and instead like a material to build <em>with</em>?”</li><br>

      <li>web design = “edgeless surface of unknown proportions, comprised of small, individual, and variable elements from multiple vantages assembled into a readable whole that documents a moment”</li><br>

      <li>start drawing, <em>then</em> put the box around it</li><br>

      <li>“we’re designing how elements break down, but really, we should be focusing on how they <em>build up</em>”</li><br>

      <li>“Technology only adds more — it is never this or that; it is always this and that.”</li><br>
