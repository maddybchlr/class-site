        <p style="margin-top:-60px; margin-left:-9px">Lay your sleeping head, <em>my love,</em>
        Human on my faithless arm:
        Time and fevers <em>burn away</em>
        Individual beauty from
        Thoughtful children, and the grave
        Proves the child <em>ephemeral:</em>
        But in my arms <em>till break of day</em>
        Let the living creature lie,
        <em>Mortal, guilty,</em> but to me
        The <em>entirely beautiful.</em>
        Soul and body have <em>no bounds:</em>
        To lovers as they lie upon
        Her tolerant enchanted slope
        In their ordinary <em>swoon,</em>
        Grave the vision Venus sends
        Of <em>supernatural sympathy,</em>
        Universal <em>love and hope;</em>
        While an abstract insight wakes
        Among the glaciers and the rocks
        The hermit's <em>carnal ecstacy.</em>
        Certainty, fidelity
        On the stroke of midnight pass
        Like <em>vibrations of a bell</em>
        And fashionable madmen raise
        Their pedantic boring cry:
        Every farthing of the cost.
        All the <em>dreaded</em> cards foretell.
        Shall be paid, but from this night
        Not a whisper, not a thought.
        <em>Not a kiss nor look be lost.</em>
        Beauty, midnight, <em>vision dies:</em>
        Let the winds of dawn that blow
        Softly round your <em>dreaming head</em>
        Such a day of welcome show
        Eye and knocking heart may bless,
        Find our <em>mortal world enough;</em>
        Noons of dryness find you fed
        By the involuntary powers,
        Nights of insult let you pass
        Watched by every human <em>love.</em></p>
