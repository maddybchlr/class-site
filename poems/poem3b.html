          The entirely beautiful.</p>

          Let the winds of dawn that blow<br>
          Softly round your dreaming head<br>
          Such a day of welcome show<br>
          Eye and knocking heart may bless,<br>
          Find our mortal world enough;<br>
          Noons of dryness find you fed<br>
          By the involuntary powers,<br>
          Nights of insult let you pass<br>
          Watched by every human love.</p>
